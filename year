int days=in. nextInt (); // Taking number of days
int year=days/365; //dividing number of days to years
int week=(days%365)/7; // dividing to weeks
int rem_days=((days%365) %7); // calculating remaining days
System.out.println("Number of Years:"+year+‚Äù, Number of     Weeks: "+week+" and Number of days:" +rem_days);
